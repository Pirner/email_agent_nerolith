# Nerolith Agent
repo for a custom model agent hand built.
Built for some automation workflows by a dev for a dev.

## Purpose

this repository builds multiple features:

- API to serve a llm for offloading GPU intense tasks locally
- MCP Server to let llm's decide what to do
- The code to run all of this
## Agent Behaviour

The idea of this application is to have a background agent
which acts independent to automate actions.
