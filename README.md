# email_agent_nerolith
repo for an email agent that processes my emails

## Purpose

this repository uses an LLM and access to an e-mail account to make decisions
with a corpus of functions defined to trigger actions afterwards.

## Agent Behaviour

The idea of this application is to have a background agent
which acts independent to automate actions.
